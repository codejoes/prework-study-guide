# prework-study-guide

## A study guide for course pre-work!

I wrote this application to help myself create a structured environment for applying the tools and abilities that my boot camp prework taught me. It helps me create organized notes and test new ideas as I learn them. I learned how to utilize HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The application contains sections for each major topic covered and each section contains notes on that topic. If the user opens the DevTools console, he/she can see the JavaScript running.
